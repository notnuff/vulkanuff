Objects we created to create a pipeline:
- Shader stages: the shader modules that define the functionality of the programmable stages of the graphics pipeline

- Fixed-function state: all of the structures that define the fixed-function stages of the pipeline, like input assembly, rasterizer, viewport and color blending

- Pipeline layout: the uniform and push values referenced by the shader that can be updated at draw time

- Render pass: the attachments referenced by the pipeline stages and their usage
