        While most of the pipeline state needs to be baked into the pipeline state, a limited amount of the state can actually be changed without recreating the pipeline at draw time. 
        Examples are the size of the viewport, line width and blend constants. 

1. Dynamic state
2. Vertex input
3. Input assembly
4. Viewports and scissors
5. Rasterizer
6. Multisampling
7. Depth and stencil testing
8. Color blending
9. Pipeline layout
