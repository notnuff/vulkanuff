1. Image views info:  
   Well, actually, that's quite simple one - to use any `VkImage`, we need
   to get a `VkImageView` of that image. It's kinda interface like
   std::string_view, but in case of Vulkan it's obligatory to use this. As
   allways, to get views, we need to specify `VkImageViewCreateInfo`. There
   are actually several interesting parameters can be configured:
    * **viewType** and **format** are just the same as in image
    * **components** field allows you to swizzle the color channels around. For
      example, you can map all of the channels to the red channel for a
      monochrome texture. You can also map constant values of 0 and 1 to a
      channel.
    * **subresourceRange** field describes what the imageâ€™s purpose is and which
      part of the image should be accessed. Here we can specify multiple layers
      which can be handy in stereographic 3D application, or mipmapping levels
